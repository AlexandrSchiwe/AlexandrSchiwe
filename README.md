 <summary><h3>🏃🏻 My coding Journey</h3></summary>
My coding journey began with a curious mind and a desire to learn. I took my first steps into the world of programming through YouTube tutorials, devouring videos on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. These online resources provided me with a solid foundation and sparked my passion for frontend development.

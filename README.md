 <summary><h3>üèÉüèª My coding Journey</h3></summary>
   "My coding journey began with a curious mind and a desire to learn. I took my first steps into the world of programming through YouTube tutorials, devouring videos on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. These online resources provided me with a solid foundation and sparked my passion for frontend development.

As I delved deeper into coding, I realized the importance of structured learning and mentorship. Eager to accelerate my growth, I made the decision to enroll in a rigorous coding bootcamp. The bootcamp experience was transformative, immersing me in a collaborative environment and exposing me to industry best practices. From problem-solving challenges to building real-world projects, it pushed me to expand my skills and reinforced my dedication to this craft.

Combining the knowledge gained from YouTube tutorials and the intensive training of the bootcamp, I now possess a comprehensive skill set and a deep appreciation for clean, efficient code. I continue to embrace lifelong learning, staying up-to-date with emerging technologies and industry trends.

My journey from self-taught beginnings to attending a coding bootcamp has fueled my ambition to contribute to impactful projects and be part of a dynamic development team. I am excited to leverage my skills and passion for clean code to create engaging user experiences and drive innovation in the world of frontend development.
